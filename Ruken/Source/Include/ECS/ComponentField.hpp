 * \brief Defines a field (or variable) for a component.

 *        The name of the inheriting class will then be the way to refer to your field.
 *        Since this name might not be unique, it is recommended to put these classes in unique namespaces for each component to avoid interferences.
 * \warning We strongly discourage the reuse of the field across multiple components even if this is possible.
 * \warning A field can only be used once per component, doing otherwise will result in undefined behaviors
