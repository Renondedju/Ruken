/**
 * \brief An exclusive component is a special kind of component;
 *        This component only exists once in the entire entity admin and isn't linked to any entity.
 *        This is useful for storing scene-wide properties like inputs, game states etc...
 *
 * Exclusive components cannot be queried like regular components.
 * Instead, you need to explicitly fetch them via the entity admin.
 *
 * \note Note that views are currently not supported using these components.
 * \tparam TUniqueId Unique ID of the component. This ID does not need to be created using a common pool with the regular components.
 *                   Ideally this would be generated automatically at compile time but doing so in c++ is
 *                   really hard and not 100% reliable. Since this ID must be unique for each component, the best way to maintain it
 *                   is using an enum enumerating every component of the game. This way if a component is deleted, the ids of every other
 *                   component will be maintained automatically. This enum must use the default values in order to work. See examples for more info.
