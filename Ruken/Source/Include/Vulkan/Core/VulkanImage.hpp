/**
 * \brief RAII-class wrapping a 'VkImage' object.
 *        Images represent multidimensional - up to 3 - arrays of data which can be used for various purposes(e.g. attachments, textures),
 *        by binding them to a graphics or compute pipeline via descriptor sets,
 *        or by directly specifying them as parameters to certain commands.
 * \note  An image must be allocated from the DeviceMemoryAllocator and the memory will be freed at object's destruction.
