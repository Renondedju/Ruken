/**
 * \brief RAII-class wrapping a timeline 'VkSemaphore' object.
 *        Semaphores are a synchronization primitive that can be used to insert a dependency
 *        between queue operations or between a queue operation and the host.
 *        Timeline semaphores have a monotonically increasing 64-bit unsigned integer payload
 *        and are signaled with respect to a particular reference value.
 *        A timeline semaphore can additionally be signaled from the host with the "Signal" command
 *        and waited on from the host with the "Wait" command.
