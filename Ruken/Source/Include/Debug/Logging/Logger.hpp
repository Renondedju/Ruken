/**
 * \brief Logger objects have a threefold job.
 *        First, they expose several methods to application code so that applications can log messages at runtime.
 *        Second, logger objects determine which log messages to act upon based upon severity (the default filtering facility) or filter objects.
 *        Third, logger objects pass along relevant log messages to all interested log handlers.
 * \note  Loggers should NEVER be instantiated directly, but always through the root logger's "AddChild" method.
