/**
 * \brief RAII-class wrapping a 'VkPipelineCache' object.
 *        Pipeline cache objects allow the result of pipeline construction to be reused between pipelines and between runs of an application.
 *        Reuse between pipelines is achieved by passing the same pipeline cache object when creating multiple related pipelines.
 *        Reuse across runs of an application is achieved by retrieving pipeline cache contents in one run of an application,
 *        saving the contents, and using them to pre-initialize a pipeline cache on a subsequent run.
